# OpenSB
OpenSB is an opensource scoreboard application for school sports, built to be used with a screen, projector, or p5/10 panel system. It can be controlled over the internet from any controlling device. OpenSB is Python Based, but can be controlled from any program that can send packets over the network.

OpenSB uses PyGame as the scoreboard front-end and using the Python Socket library to receive commands to alter scores, start countdowns, and set other functions.
